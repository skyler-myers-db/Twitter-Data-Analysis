# Group 5 Project 2
# Questions to Answer

The principal focus is to understand the impact Twitter has on the financial market, specifically cryptocurrencies. Different trends amongst the most popular crypto assets are analyzed and underlying correlations are determined. Specific attention is paid to high profile figures joining in on the crypto tweeting action, and the impact they have on the trends overall.

1. When Dogecoin is trending on Twitter, is Bitcoin also trending; if so, how correlated are they? If not, what is their relationship?
2. When a high-profile public figure tweets about a certain crypto, such as Elon Musk with Dogecoin, what is the impact on its stock value? (he tweets about it a lot)
3. How often are public figure tweets about crypto retweeted relative to other tweets? Technology
4. How are other ‘meme-stocks’ such as $GME & $AMC correlated with $DOGE?
5. What time of day is relatively most popular in regards to these crypto assets?
